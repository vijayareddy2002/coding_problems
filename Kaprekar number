Jaffer wanted to excel in Math. He was learning about the Kaprekar number from Meena, his Maths teacher. She gave him a few random numbers and asked him to find out whether they are Kaprekar number or not.

(Consider an n-digit number k. Square it and add the right n digits to the left n or n-1 digits. If the resultant sum is k, then k is called a Kaprekar number. For example, 9 is a Kaprekar number since 9^2 = 81 & 8 + 1 = 9, similarly, 297 is a Kaprekar number as 297^2 = 88209 & 88 + 209 = 297 ).

Can you help Jaffer to write a program to find whether the given number is a Kaprekar number or not?

rf=int(input())
rg=rf**2
fg=str(rg)
fg1=fg[::-1]
yh=fg1[:len(str(rf))]
yh2=int(str(fg)[:len(str(rf))])
yh3=int(yh[::-1])
uf=yh3+yh2
if uf==rf:
  print("Kaprekar Number")
else:
  print("Not a Kaprekar Number")
